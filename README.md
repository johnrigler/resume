Some subsections refreshes every 5 seconds, just remove to meta tag to stop that. This is more or less viewable in sections as subdirectories.  Yes, its just my resume, but it is gaining functionality, check out the git function in index.php under work/sbs.

##1 INTRODUCTION

This makes updating your resume/CV a joy if you happen to be a PHP hacker.  I load the page in LibreOffice and then save it as a Word document before sending it off.  No need to trapse into the world of Windows.

## 2 LICENSING

This software is released under the Apache 2.0 license, a copy of which is located in the LICENSE file.  It also has my work data interspersed within it, so copying that would be pretty wierd.  One day soon, it will have interchangeable yaml file with all of the data.

##3 BUILDING

To use this solution, follow the steps shown below to obtain the source. Apache and PHP are required.

       git clone https://github.com/johnrigler/resume

##4 DOWNLOADS

This is currently a NoSQL directory solution, everything you need is in index.php, body.php, or a subdirectory.  

##5 DOCUMENTATION

This is it.  Good luck.  Hire me and I will fix this all up nice.

##6 INSTALLATION

Make sure to clone to a directory accessible from the web.  This isn't converted into a library yet.

##7 DEVELOPMENT

This is developed on a Ubuntu server.  I ssh over and just run vim.  I also have a meta refresh tag in the code, so I can do the bulk of my work in one screen and just watch the browser refresh with my changes, I know within seconds if I have broken something.

##8 COMMUNITY

Anyone is welcome to call or email me.  john@rigler.org or 469-563-8811.  But, its just my resume really.

##9 CONTRIBUTIONS

If you improve the base code, do load it back to github and let me know.

##10 PROBLEMS

This is open source software. I can support this for a fee.
