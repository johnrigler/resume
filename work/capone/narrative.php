About 8 months, contract to hire,  great experience.  

Challenges:
Beaurocratic, took a long time to do anything.  Example: They supported the Open Source, but it was difficult.  The name of your project had to be obscure because there was a fear that names like ours (Bifrost) might have a copywrite issue.  Used Atlassian software: Jira and Hipchat, Ansible, explored Jenkins and salt.

To mitigate the confusion, I created an SQLITE Database, mirrored the data structure of TeraData (which also came from HPSA).  We had to auto-generate a hostlist with special flags for Ansible to work.  Ansible responsed with colored status which I was able to capture and reproduce on a website.

Bifrost was a set of libraries that I developed with a Web component that was able to capture the Ansible output from the shell and log it in a clean way.

  We were looking at things like how to manage change windows in an automated fashion.  

Management:  
I wasn't leading the direction, but could tell that management was concerned that it was all going to come together.

Questions:
What is 100% of the environment?  Do we have an exact count in prod, test, unit test.  What is the pre-prod to prod process?  Does everyone understand.  
Overall, it was a good experience.
