I had two managers, three managers, some exact # of months 
I worked on the Smithfield Packing, Alliance Data, and Blue Cross Blue Sheild of North 
Carolina.  We used CA products.. We practiced ITIL. I built out new AIX and Linux servers, sometimes
virtualized.  I supported AIX and Linux servers for Smithfield as the primary.

Support:
Smithfield &#45; Primary  8 racks of servers that I supported
Blue Cross Blue Shield &#45; Configured from terminal Datapower appliances

Network Issues: VLAN and switch for Alliance Data and Smithfield

New Projects:
Installed new Servers from Embaer.  Positive Reviews???? Jon

Problems:
Worked for three different companies that didn't talk to each other.  No one understood each other, Alliance Data, BCBSNC, 

Built entire Smithfield Infrastructure myself, but Perhaps they thought they were.  Different version 
and instances of CMDB, none had access (like Capital One Teradata Extract)

Each customer was on a completely different network.  Could not manage together, PHC isolated this 
even more.  One account, I had to access as one of their employees.

Would have loved to configure Puppet, but the environment wasn't reasonable or ready.  I wanted CMDB access to just make them right.

One project was setting up using the Fujitsu SAN for Replication from prod. to DR in Sunnyvale.  Wanted to monitor from a central place.  I couldn't monitor from the OS, I had to use the remote Fujitsu  
tool.  Had to open two remote desktops.  There were problems that I couldn't solve.  Controlled by someone else who I couldn't even figure out who to talk to.

Embraer

We used a NAT to separate our network from theirs.  I was supposed to build a Redhat Server for a BMC solution .  Normal requirements. Contractor couldn't install the product because he didn't know how to configure RAC.

Configure Oracle RAC on two Linux Servers, with a backup network and an access NAT network.

Configured Postfix.

SAN migrations
DR
